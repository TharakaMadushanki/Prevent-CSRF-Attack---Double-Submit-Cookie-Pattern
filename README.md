# Prevent-CSRF-Attack---Double-Submit-Cookie-Pattern

The usage of this sample application is discussed in my blogpost https://tharakaliyanage.blogspot.com/2018/09/double-submit-cookie-pattern-previously.html

Instructions: Download the project folder,extract it and put inside xampp/htdocs (If you are using XAMPP Server). Most of the time xampp will be inside C:/ Drive. Then start the xampp server and open the browser and type localhost/<folder_name>.

eg: localhost/CSRF_Prevention_Double-Submit-Cookie-Pattern
